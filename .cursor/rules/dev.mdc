description: Use dev CLI for project commands
alwaysApply: true
---
When running project commands (test, build, setup, release, etc.), always use
`dev <command>` instead of directly invoking bin/ scripts. The dev tool handles
Ruby version resolution and environment setup via shadowenv.

- `dev test` not `./bin/test.rb`
- `dev up` not `./bin/setup.rb`
- `dev build` not `./bin/build.sh`

Run `dev` with no arguments to see all available commands from dev.yml.
